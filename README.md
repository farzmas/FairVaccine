# FairVaccine
The potential project to do while at the Data Incubator. 

Several parameters play a role in the allocation of Covid-19 vaccine distribution, such as the size, risk profiles, and fraction of vulnerable groups in the population. This project goal is
* To develop an efficient and fair resource allocation algorithm for Covid-19 vaccine distribution to help the police maker adopt strategies that minimize the intensity of infection and ensure equity in the vaccine distribution. 
* Inspired by Vaccinateca.com in California, to develop an interactive application for the general public about the available Covide-19 vaccination center around them.
