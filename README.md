# FairVaccine

Several parameters play a role in the allocation of Covid-19 vaccine distribution, such as the size, risk profiles, and fraction of vulnerable groups in the population. In this project, the goal is to develop an efficient and fair resource allocation algorithm for Covid-19 vaccine distribution to help the police maker adopt strategies that minimize the intensity of infection and ensure equity in the vaccine distribution.
